# JupyterLab Docker Image

This is a simple dockerized JupyterLab instance that I created because I needed
to run an instance for a project I was working on.  The only requirements are:

* Docker
* docker-compose


To run the instance,

```shell
docker-compose up
```

The password is `jupyter` (see [Dockerfile](Dockerfile)).
